However, although there were generic simulations to look at the MAP in general, case-specific examples were not necessarily evaluated (I don't know of any), and when the statement is made that it is ""considered precautionary"", it is because of the way the Fmsy ranges were defined using software that cannot be considered conducting an MSE (the software is used to define reference points and is extremely limited in terms of sources of uncertainty considered - if you are interested you can have a look at the WKMSYREF series of reports, particularly 3 and 4).
